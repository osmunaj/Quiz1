        <!-- <h1>Mission Statement:</h1>
        <h3>- Target Audience -</h3>
        <p>Beginner musicians Learning 
            about the basics of scale 
            patters and intervals </p>
        <h3>- Problem being solved -</h3>
        <p>The user imputs any note to
            use as the tonic, as well as 
            the type of scale, and the 
            program outputs all the notes
            of that scale as well as other
            useful information like chords</p>
        <h3>- Why it will be useful -</h3>
        <p>This will help any new musicians
            understand the patters and theory
            of different scales. As a beginner
            musician, I had trouble for a while
            understanding how scale patterns work,
            and I believe this will help.</p> -->
